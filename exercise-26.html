</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I am almost done with the first half of the book! It&#8217;s <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex26.html">Exercise 26</a> for today and I get to fix bad code!&nbsp;Nice!</p>
<p>A wise&nbsp;warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you continue, I have a quiz for you. This quiz will be very hard because it requires you to fix someone else&#8217;s code. When you are a programmer you often have to deal with other programmers&#8217; code, and also with their arrogance. Programmers will very frequently claim that their code is&nbsp;perfect.</p>
<p>These programmers are stupid people who care little for others. A good programmer assumes, like a good scientist, that there&#8217;s always some probability their code is wrong. Good programmers start from the premise that their software is broken and then work to rule out all possible ways it could be wrong before finally admitting that maybe it really is the other guy&#8217;s&nbsp;code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen. A million&nbsp;amens.</p>
<p>What I came up&nbsp;with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Exercise 26
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex26.html

def break_words(stuff):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;This function will break up words for us.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    words = stuff.split(&#39; &#39;)
    return words

def sort_words(words):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Sorts the words.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sorted(words)

def print_first_word(words):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints the first word after popping it off.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    word = words.pop(0)
    print word

def print_last_word(words):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints the last word after popping it off.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    word = words.pop(-1)
    print word

def sort_sentence(sentence):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Takes in a full sentence and returns the sorted words.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    words = break_words(sentence)
    return sort_words(words)

def print_first_and_last(sentence):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints the first and last words of the sentence.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    words = break_words(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)

def print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Sorts the words then prints the first and last one.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    words = sort_sentence(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)


print &quot;Let&#39;s practice everything.&quot;
print &#39;You\&#39;d need to know \&#39;bout escapes with \\ that do \n newlines and \t tabs.&#39;

poem = &quot;&quot;&quot;
\tThe lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern \n the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation
\n\t\twhere there is none.
&quot;&quot;&quot;


print &quot;--------------&quot;
print poem
print &quot;--------------&quot;

five = 10 - 2 + 3 - 6
print &quot;This should be five: %s&quot; % five

def secret_formula(started):
    jelly_beans = started * 500
    jars = jelly_beans / 1000
    crates = jars / 100
    return jelly_beans, jars, crates


start_point = 10000
beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)

print &quot;With a starting point of: %d&quot; % start_point
print &quot;We&#39;d have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates.&quot; % (beans, jars, crates)

start_point = start_point / 10

print &quot;We can also do that this way:&quot;
print &quot;We&#39;d have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crabapples.&quot; % secret_formula(start_point)


sentence = &quot;All good\tthings come to those who wait.&quot;

words = break_words(sentence)
sorted_words = sort_words(words)

print_first_word(words)
print_last_word(words)
print_first_word(sorted_words)
print_last_word(sorted_words)
sorted_words = sort_sentence(sentence)
print sorted_words

print_first_and_last(sentence)

print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence)

<p>Let&#8217;s run&nbsp;it:</p>
<p><img alt="Exercise 26" src="/images/ex26.png" title="Exercise 26"></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> that&#8217;s correct. It&#8217;s hard to know without seeing the answer. Lots of syntax errors, misspellings of function names, and even misspellings of words in strings. Spelling nerds of the world,&nbsp;unite.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little more interesting (and useful) to see the diff between the two files. Fortunately, because I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw">GitHub</a> to save my work on this blog, I can show the difference. Check it out: the <a href="https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw/blob/13fdf52eedbc0dbdc2eb2c0b656a4b2fa1e74bd5/exercises/ex26.py">before file</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw/blob/master/exercises/ex26.py">after file</a>. And now for the <a href="https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw/commit/7c95e54462a2309931fdfb7cb6afb595f9569efe?diff=split">pretty diff view</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction to this lesson left a big impression on me. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, remember this: There will be  people who think that their code is perfect. They will be offended. They will tell you they are offended. They will take it out on you. Don&#8217;t let them bring you down. Your job is to make sure things work, and you have to power through and do whatever it takes to make that&nbsp;happen.</p>
