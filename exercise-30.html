<p>And how it&nbsp;looks:</p>
<p><img alt="Exercise 30" src="/images/ex30.png" title="Exercise 30"></p>
<p><code>elif</code> is short hand for &#8220;else if,&#8221; which is another conditional evaluated only when the prior statement is <code>False</code>, and <code>else</code> is finally the catch all. <code>elif</code> was always sort of odd to me, in name and partially in logic. Python is usually highly readable and doesn&#8217;t abbreviate or truncate too many things. <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>and</code>, and <code>or</code> are all highly readable. Even <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are capitalized. Maybe <code>else if</code> is a bit too far because it conflicts with <code>else</code> (although I don&#8217;t see much of a problem if a <code>:</code> denotes the end of a conditional line), but this is one of those areas where JavaScript got it right with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else"><code>else if</code></a>.</p>
<p>I also remember when <code>elif</code> <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3100">made it</a> into Django&#8217;s template language as <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/builtins/#if"><code>{% elif %}</code></a>, which was a <em>big deal</em>. The argument was that template&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t contain too much logic, and that <code>elif</code> can be supplanted by nesting additional <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<p>Here is today&#8217;s&nbsp;exercise:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if cars &gt; people:
    print &quot;We should take the cars.&quot;
elif cars &lt; people:
    print &quot;We should not take the cars.&quot;
else:
    print &quot;We can&#39;t decide.&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>And rewritten for nested <code>if</code> statements without <code>elif</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if cars &gt; people:
    print &quot;We should take the cars.&quot;
else:
    if cars &lt; people:
        print &quot;We should not take the cars.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;We can&#39;t decide.&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>The second version is arguably more readable, but more verbose. However, I think <code>elif</code> shines when the conditional is simply one line, in which case it becomes a quick run through of evaluating statements. If you need more verbose checking and logic, then expand as necessary. There are some subtle implications in writing code like this. Should <code>print "We can't decide."</code> really be nested? In this scenario, there&#8217;s no other possible routes, but it could have implications in more complicated code. I might prefer to write it in a more &#8220;positive&#8221; way by explicitly understanding what we&#8217;re&nbsp;evaluating:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if cars == people:
    print &quot;We can&#39;t decide.&quot;
else:
    if cars &gt; people:
        print &quot;We should take the cars.&quot;
    if cars &lt; people:
        print &quot;We should not take the cars.&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>In this particular case, there&#8217;s no problem in just omitting <code>elif</code> all together, simply because less than and greater than are <em>mutually exclusive</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if cars &gt; people:
    print &quot;We should take the cars.&quot;
if cars &lt; people:
    print &quot;We should not take the cars.&quot;
if cars == people:
    print &quot;We can&#39;t decide.&quot;
</pre></div>
