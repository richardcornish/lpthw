</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I was a little late but I finished <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html">exercise 4</a> tonight. I learned about&nbsp;variables.</p>
<p>I entered these lines into a <code>.py</code> file and ran it with <code>python ex04.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Exercise 4
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html

# Number of total cars
cars = 100

# Number of spaces in each car
space_in_a_car = 4

# Number of total drivers
drivers = 30

# Number of total passengers
passengers = 90

# Cars left over without drivers
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers

# Each driver represents a car driven
cars_driven = drivers

# All the cars times the space in each car equal the total capacity
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car

# The average number of passengers is all passengers divided by total cars driven
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven


print &quot;There are&quot;, cars, &quot;cars available.&quot;
print &quot;There are only&quot;, drivers, &quot;drivers available.&quot;
print &quot;There will be&quot;, cars_not_driven, &quot;empty cars today.&quot;
print &quot;We can transport&quot;, carpool_capacity, &quot;people today.&quot;
print &quot;We have&quot;, passengers, &quot;to carpool today.&quot;
print &quot;We need to put about&quot;, average_passengers_per_car, &quot;in each car.&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>He said in his&nbsp;lesson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain&nbsp;why.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;ex4.py&quot;, line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name &#39;car_pool_capacity&#39; is not defined
</pre></div>


<p>First, <code>car_pool_capacity</code> is not the name of the variable. It&#8217;s <code>carpool_capacity</code>. Admittedly I didn&#8217;t catch this until the plugin of my text editor, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, highlighted a line error for me. I use <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> to more easily write <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and it comes with a <a href="https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries">PyV8</a>, a Python lint checker, which is great at catching little syntax erorrs. Maybe this is &#8220;cheating,&#8221; but if a tool can help you get your work done faster, I&#8217;m all for it. We&#8217;re all using computers, am I right? Plus I noticed on my own that <code>passenger</code> is not a variable name, but <code>passengers</code> is.</p>
<p>But maybe more serious is the conceptual computation, even if the variables were&nbsp;&#8220;correct&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>average_passengers_per_car = carpool_capacity / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (cars_driven * space_in_a_car) / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (drivers * space_in_a_car) / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (30 * 4.0) / 90
average_passengers_per_car = 120.0 / 90
average_passengers_per_car = 1.3333333333333333
</pre></div>


<p>Dividing the capacity by the number of passengers doesn&#8217;t make any sense. That&#8217;s far worse than misspelling variables. What if your program ran as a false positive, without mistake? This is called a <em>semantic error</em>, one of the <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython002.html#toc6">three kinds of errors that can occur</a>. I learned this several years ago from &#8220;<a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a>,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a shame a lot of people don&#8217;t learn the basics and rush into programming without slowing&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>What the right way looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / drivers
average_passengers_per_car = 90 / 30
average_passengers_per_car = 3
</pre></div>


<p>The value for <code>space_in_a_car</code>, 4.0, doesn&#8217;t seem to be necessary as a floating point number. Spaces are whole numbers, integers (unless you count the bitch seat). It&#8217;s only used to compute <code>carpool_capacity</code>, which is a product of <code>cars_driven</code> and <code>space_in_a_car</code>. Floating unnecessarily adds a decimal point and&nbsp;digits.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to see him already acknowledging string formatting in the &#8220;common student questions,&#8221; e.g. <code>print "Hey %s there." % "you"</code>, but I&#8217;m kind of bummed <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/#mutable-and-immutable-types">it changed in Python 3</a>. Some simple things seemed to have gotten complicated in Python 3, but I hope it makes more sense to me later when (if?) I ever learn more about the next&nbsp;version.</p>
