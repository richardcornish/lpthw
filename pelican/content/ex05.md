Title: Exercise 5
Date: 2014-11-11 1:14AM

Another late night with Python. Tonight was [exercise 5](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex5.html) and it covered string formatting and replacement.

I entered these lines into a `.py` file and ran it with `python ex05.py`:

```
# Exercise 5
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex5.html

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall." % height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (
    age, height, weight, age + height + weight)


# Study drills
height_cm = height * 2.54 # cm
weight_kg = weight * 0.453592 # kg

print "He's %d centimeters tall." % height_cm
print "He's %d kilograms heavy." % weight_kg

# %r format character
r = "Print this no matter what"
print "Here is what %%r does: %r" % r
```

Nothing too crazy, just some string formatting, specifically decimal, `%d`, representation, `%r`, and string, `%s`. Here are all of the [Python format characters](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations).

A quick search on Google brings up all of the Imperial-Metric conversions that I forgot from middle school:

- 1 in = 2.54 cm
- 1 lb = 0.453592 kg

Now, can anyone go back and do formatting and replacing of all my traumatic middle school memories? Because that would be fabulous.
