Title: Exercise 22
Date: 2014-11-28 8:20PM

[Exercise 22](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex22.html) is kind of strange. There isn't any code to write; it's just reviewing all the types, methods, variables, functions, and other code we've learned so far. Here goes.

- [comments](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#comments)

    Comments allow you to describe your code without it being executed. They should usually be fewer than 80 characters and each line is preceded by an octothorpe (`#`).

- [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings)

    Docstrings are comments that more thoroughly describe the code around it, usually inside a class or method, and preceded and succeded by three double quotation marks (`"""`).

- [variables](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#delimiters)

    Variables are places in memory in which values are saved. They can be referred in several places in code, and can be overwritten. A concept this fundamental was surprisingly hard to find in the docs, and I'm not sure this was the correct link.

- [functions](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#function)

    An executable statement that can use parameters to act on variables and can return a result of maniuplating the parameters.

- [strings](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals)

    A sequence of characters, often interpreted literally.

- [escape sequences](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals)

    Special characters in strings that require escaping to be displayed, usually by a backslash.

- [numbers](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#numeric-literals)

    A sequence of numerals, often integers, but possibly floats or decimals.

- [files](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects)

    A file loaded into memory as an object.

- [`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations)

    Binary arithmetic operators; performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The last is "modulo," which returns the integer remainder after division of two numbers.

- [`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons)

    Comparison operators; greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.

- [`%s`, `%d`, `%r`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting)

    Special escape sequences used to format strings, digits, and raw interpretation into other strings, often sequentially after the termination of a string and a modulo symbol.

- [`print`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#print)

    Displays text, usually strings, to the console.

- [`import`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#modules)

    Finds and loads an external Python module for use in the code.

- [`argv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

    Variable arguments; allows arguments to be passed to a file when run from the console.

- [`raw_input`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input)

    A way of prompting the user for input from the console.

- [`len`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#len)

    A method that returns the number of characters of a string or other object's length.

- [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open)

    A method that opens a file on disk.

- [`file.seek`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek)

    A method on file objects that places the cursor after a specified byte.

- [`file.read`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.read)

    A method on file objects that copies the contents of a file into memory.

- [`file.readline`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.readline)

    A method on file objects that copies the contents of a single line of a file into memory.

- [`file.write`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.write)

    A method on file objects that overwrites the contents of a file.

- [`file.close`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.close)

    A method on file objects that close the file out of memory.

- [`os.path.exists`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.exists)

    A method from the operating system module that checks for the existence of a file's path.

- [`*args`](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-parameter)

    A convention for passing several variables into one argument of a function.

- [`return`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#return)

    A reserved word in a function that stops the function from further execution, possibly sending a value back to where the function was first called.

- [`True`, `False`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-values)

    Possible values of boolean objects
