Title: Exercise 26
Date: 2014-12-11 5:43PM

I am almost done with the first half of the book! It's [Exercise 26](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex26.html) for today and I get to fix bad code! Nice!

> Before you continue, I have a quiz for you. This quiz will be very hard because it requires you to fix someone else's code. When you are a programmer you often have to deal with other programmers' code, and also with their arrogance. Programmers will very frequently claim that their code is perfect.
>  
> These programmers are stupid people who care little for others. A good programmer assumes, like a good scientist, that there's always some probability their code is wrong. Good programmers start from the premise that their software is broken and then work to rule out all possible ways it could be wrong before finally admitting that maybe it really is the other guy's code.

I *think* that's correct. It's hard to know without seeing the answer. Lots of syntax errors, misspellings of function names, and even misspellings of words in strings. Spelling nerds of the world, unite.

It's a little more interesting (and useful) to see the diff between the two files. Fortunately, because I've been using [GitHub](https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw) to save my work on this blog, I can show the difference. Check it out: the [before file](https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw/blob/master/exercises/ex26.py) and the [after file](https://github.com/richardcornish/lpthw/blob/master/exercises/ex26.py).

The introduction to this lesson left a big impression on me. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, remember this: There will be  people who think that their code is perfect. They will be offended. They will tell you they are offended. They will take it out on you. Don't let them bring you down. Your job is to make sure things work, and you have to power through and do whatever it takes to make that happen.
