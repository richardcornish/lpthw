Title: Exercise 7
Date: 2014-11-12 8:31PM

Another day, another exercise. Tonight was [exercise 7](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex7.html).

```
# Exercise 7
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex7.html

# Print first line of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" nursery rhyme
print "Mary had a little lamb."

# Print second line of nursery rhyme with string formatting of "snow"
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'

# Print third line of nursery rhyme
print "And everywhere that Mary went."

# Print the period character 10 times
print "." * 10 # what'd that do?

# Assign each letter of "CheeseBurger" to a respective ascending variable
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# Prints the concatenation of variables end1-end6, a space via the comma, and
# continues to print the concatenation of variables end7-end12
# Removing the comma forces a line break between both lines

# watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
```

And here is what it looked like:

I was a little surprised by today's lesson. The last three lessons have all been mostly about line printing, variables, and string concatenation and formatting. I know it gets harder later on, but writing comments for every line, no matter how droll, gets tedious.

The asterisk symbol is interesting because it's a rare moment of overloading an operator other than the plus symbol. Just to compare the mess of overloading operators in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript...

Addition and concatenation of numbers:

|   | Python | Ruby | JavaScript |
| - | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| 1 + 10 | 11 | 11 | 11 |
| "1" + 10 | TypeError | TypeError | **"110"** |
| 1 + "10" | TypeError | TypeError | **"110"** |
| "1" + "10" | "110" | "110" | "110" |

Multiplication and repetition of numbers:

|   | Python | Ruby | JavaScript |
| - | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| 1 * 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| "1" * 10 | "1111111111" | "1111111111" | **10** |
| 1 * "10" | "10" | **TypeError** | **10** |
| "1" * "10" | TypeError | TypeError | **10** |

Addition and concatenation of strings and numbers:

|   | Python | Ruby | JavaScript |
| - | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| "1" + "jessica" | "1jessica" | "1jessica" | "1jessica" |
| 1 + "jessica" | TypeError | TypeError | **"1jessica"** |
| "jessica" + "1" | "jessica1" | "jessica1" | "jessica1" |
| "jessica" + 1 | TypeError | TypeError | **"jessica1"** |

Multiplication and repetition of strings and numbers:

|   | Python | Ruby | JavaScript |
| - | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| "1" * "jessica" | TypeError | TypeError | NaN |
| 1 * "jessica" | "jessica" | **TypeError** | NaN |
| "jessica" * "1" | TypeError | TypeError | NaN |
| "jessica" * 1 | "jessica" | "jessica" | NaN |

I bolded the offenders that stood out to me personally. The multiplication of a string is not unique to Python, but its *consistency* is. Ruby will repeat a string, but only when *the string is on the left*. [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)?

JavaScript, however, gets the blue ribbon for having loosest morals, coercing anything it can into a string *except* when the coercion from string to number doesn't make sense *or* when the asterisk is used. Then it starts losing its mind, sticking its fingers into its ears and saying [`NaN`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) over and over.

I think it's time to take ol' JavaScript out behind the shed and put 'er down.

*sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh*

*pats 'er on the head*

There, there. It's going to be all right. It'll all be over soon.
