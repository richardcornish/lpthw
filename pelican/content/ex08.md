Title: Exercise 8
Date: 2014-11-14 9:51PM

I fell behind last night and didn't do my exercise. I'm going to make up for it with two of them tonight. The first one up is [exercise 8](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html).

```
# Exercise 8
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html

formatter = "%r %r %r %r"

print formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4)
print formatter % ("one", "two", "three", "four")
print formatter % (True, False, False, True)
print formatter % (formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter)
print formatter % (
    "I had this thing.",
    "That you could type up right.",
    "But it didn't sing.",
    "So I said goodnight."
)
```

A screenshot to prove my 133t status:

The last line uses double quotes to enclose the strings that use single quotes because Python would otherwise prematurely process the single quotation marks inside the string, which would result in Python trying to process the remaining portion of the string as business logic, casuing an error.

And let us never speak of this moment ever again.

Because I'll lose my mind if I have to explain this concept to another human being for the rest of my life.

Amen.
