Title: Exercise 2
Date: 2014-11-07 8:05PM

Today was [exercise 2](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex2.html). I learned how to make comments for single lines.

I entered these lines into a `.py` file and ran it with `python ex02.py`:

```
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
```

I tend to use single-line comments only when I'm doing something noteworthy in my code, most often a critical point that can't tolerate any errors. For classes and methods, I try to use [docstrings](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), although I tend to make all my docstrings multiline.

It's interesting to note that while Python prefers the imperative mood (or, commands) for its [code style](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), e.g. `return`, while Django prefers the present tense (or, "action words") for its [code style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/), e.g. `returns`.
