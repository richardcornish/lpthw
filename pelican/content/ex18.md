Title: Exercise 18
Date: 2014-11-25 12:02AM

I didn't feel like slogging through [Exercise 18](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex18.html) last night, but I'm back on it tonight. It's time for one of the foundational parts of programming: functions!

```
# Exercise 18
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex18.html

# this one is like your scripts with argv
def print_two(*args):
    arg1, arg2 = args
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" % (arg1, arg2)

# ok, that *args is actually pointless, we can just do this
def print_two_again(arg1, arg2):
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" % (arg1, arg2)

# this just takes one argument
def print_one(arg1):
    print "arg1: %r" % arg1

# this one takes no arguments
def print_none():
    print "I got nothin'."

print_two("Zed","Shaw")
print_two_again("Zed","Shaw")
print_one("First!")
print_none()
```

[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions) are in some way the most conceptually fundamental part of programming. We can all understand the benefits of strings and numbers and storing them into variables, but the ability to send them away and receive something else back, efficiently and without repetition, was likely a groundbreaking moment for programming.

Sometimes I forget how foreign the concept of functions are to people. I still remember when I had to look up the syntax for functions in JavaScript (all three kinds). In Python, you have to remember:

1. Did you start your function definition with `def`?
2. Does your function name have only characters and `_` (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open parenthesis `(` right after the function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis `(` separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon `):` after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
8. Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

I don't really even think about all that stuff. It's likely this is similar to how people [learn to play the piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnufOkguW2E).
