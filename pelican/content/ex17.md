Title: Exercise 17
Date: 2014-11-24 2:08AM

Tonight was [Exercise 17](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex17.html), and we're learning how to copy one file's contents into another.

```
# Exercise 17
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex17.html

from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)

# we could do these two on one line, how?
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)

print "Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file)
print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort."
raw_input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."

out_file.close()
in_file.close()
```

The study drill encouraged me to read about `cat` in the manual.

My guess on the necessity of [closing the file](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.close) is that without it, it can be read or written by other code that might follow it. It might also be a memory issue.

Another study drill encouraged me to read about the [`import` statement](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#import). It's kind of funny reading about it. It's so fundamental to Python and was probably among the first code I typed. At first it felt strange and foreign to me, but traversing the file system with dotted sytax and importing the module directly or by directory also came across as an incredibly elegant syntax to me.

As for the fun part about writing this code into one line:

```
from sys import argv; script, from_file, to_file = argv; open(to_file, 'w').write(open(from_file).read())
```

It's not *too* hard: Replace the variables with their value equivalents and get rid of all of the print statements and command prompts. Whether it's *user friendly*...good designers always design for personas and not the all-encompassing generic user. ;)
