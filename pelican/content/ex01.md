Title: Exercise 1
Date: 2014-11-06 11:55PM

I worked through [exercise 1](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.html) tonight. It was, hrm, basic.

I entered these lines in a `.py` file and ran it with `python ex01.py`:

```
print "Hello World!"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
```

I typed them out like Zed said to.

Here's a screenshot of it.

I look forward to the more advanced material.
