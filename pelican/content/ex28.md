Title: Exercise 28
Date: 2017-04-18 3:42PM

[Today's exercise](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex28.html) is applying truth tables to statements to arrive at the boolean answers.

```
# Exercise 28
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex28.html

print True and True  # True
print False and True  # False
print 1 == 1 and 2 == 1  # False
print "test" == "test"  # True
print 1 == 1 or 2 != 1  # True
print True and 1 == 1  # True
print False and 0 != 0  # False
print True or 1 == 1  # True
print "test" == "testing"  # False
print 1 != 0 and 2 == 1  # False
print "test" != "testing"  # True
print "test" == 1  # False
print not (True and False)  # True
print not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1)  # False
print not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000)  # False
print not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4)  # False
print not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy")  # True
print 1 == 1 and (not ("testing" == 1 or 1 == 0))  # True
print "chunky" == "bacon" and (not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3))  # False
print 3 == 3 and (not ("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun"))  # False
```

And evaluating each:

Here are the [equality operators](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons) from the study drill:

| Operation | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| `<` | strictly less than |
| `<=` | less than or equal |
| `>` | strictly greater than |
| `>=` | greater than or equal |
| `==` | equal |
| `!=` | not equal |
| `is` | object identity |
| `is not` | negated object identity |

I'm a little surprised that there is no mention of "[truthiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)" in the exercise, but maybe that's a little advanced at the moment. If you study each of the statements, you'll notice that each was written as a comparison of equality rather than standalone truth tests.

For example, `1 == 1 and 2 == 1` or `"test" == "testing"` ultimately evaluates to `True` or `False`. But is `1`...`True`? Is `"test"`?

[Python's docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing) list what values are `False`:

- `None`
- `False` (duh)
- `0` (and zero equivalents in floats, etc.)
- `[]`
- `()`
- `''`

One of my favorites is a `datetime` object whose value is midnight. Objects are usually truthy, but [not so for midnight](https://lwn.net/Articles/590299/). Ruh roh.

```
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.time(0, 0, 0) == True
False
```

 And guess what? It hasn't changed for Python 3! That ship has sailed!

I love it when developers debate semantics as interfaces with the world because it shows they're *just as much of a designer as a UX designer is*. Their medium just happens to be code. You wouldn't know it, but they want intuition as much as the next person.

> There's a great saying in the usability world: "You can't document your way out of a usability problem". What it means is that if all the affordances of your application (or programming language!) push users towards a particular logical conclusion (in this case, "datetime.time values are not numbers"), having a caveat in your documentation isn't going to help, because people aren't even going to think to ask the question. It doesn't matter if you originally had a good reason for the behaviour, you've ended up in a place where your behaviour is confusing and inconsistent, because there is one piece of behaviour that is out of line with an otherwise consistent mental model.
