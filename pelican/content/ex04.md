Title: Exercise 4
Date: 2014-11-09 11:49PM

I was a little late but I finished [exercise 4](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html) tonight. I learned about variables.

I entered these lines into a `.py` file and ran it with `python ex04.py`:

```
# Exercise 4
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html

# Number of total cars
cars = 100

# Number of spaces in each car
space_in_a_car = 4

# Number of total drivers
drivers = 30

# Number of total passengers
passengers = 90

# Cars left over without drivers
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers

# Each driver represents a car driven
cars_driven = drivers

# All the cars times the space in each car equal the total capacity
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car

# The average number of passengers is all passengers divided by total cars driven
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven


print "There are", cars, "cars available."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car."
```

He said in his lesson:

> Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined
```

First, `car_pool_capacity` is not the name of the variable. It's `carpool_capacity`. Admittedly I didn't catch this until the plugin of my text editor, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), highlighted a line error for me. I use [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) to more easily write HTML and CSS, and it comes with a [PyV8](https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries), a Python lint checker, which is great at catching little syntax erorrs. Maybe this is "cheating," but if a tool can help you get your work done faster, I'm all for it. We're all using computers, am I right? Plus I noticed on my own that `passenger` is not a variable name, but `passengers` is.

But maybe more serious is the conceptual computation, even if the variables were "correct":

```
average_passengers_per_car = carpool_capacity / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (cars_driven * space_in_a_car) / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (drivers * space_in_a_car) / passengers
average_passengers_per_car = (30 * 4.0) / 90
average_passengers_per_car = 120.0 / 90
average_passengers_per_car = 1.3333333333333333
```

Dividing the capacity by the number of passengers doesn't make any sense. That's far worse than misspelling variables. What if your program ran as a false positive, without mistake? This is called a *semantic error*, one of the [three kinds of errors that can occur](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython002.html#toc6). I learned this several years ago from "[Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/)," but it's a shame a lot of people don't learn the basics and rush into programming without slowing down.

What the right way looks like:

```
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / drivers
average_passengers_per_car = 90 / 30
average_passengers_per_car = 3
```

The value for `space_in_a_car`, 4.0, doesn't seem to be necessary as a floating point number. Spaces are whole numbers, integers (unless you count the bitch seat). It's only used to compute `carpool_capacity`, which is a product of `cars_driven` and `space_in_a_car`. Floating unnecessarily adds a decimal point and digits.

I'm glad to see him already acknowledging string formatting in the "common student questions," e.g. `print "Hey %s there." % "you"`, but I'm kind of bummed [it changed in Python 3](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/#mutable-and-immutable-types). Some simple things seemed to have gotten complicated in Python 3, but I hope it makes more sense to me later when (if?) I ever learn more about the next version.
