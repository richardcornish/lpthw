The methods we used:

- [`split`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)

    Separates a string with a separator and returns a list. In this case, we're separating words when a space is found.

- [`sorted`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted)

    Sorts items in an [interable](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable).

- [`pop`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set.pop)

    Removes and returns the indexed item out of a list. A negative index means start from the right.
