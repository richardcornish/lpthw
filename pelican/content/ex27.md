Title: Exercise 27
Date: 2014-12-14 1:06PM

I have now officially passed the halfway point of this programmatic thrill ride. I can barely...*function*.

Today's exercise is to memorize logic, specifically [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table). Ah, truth tables. I remember you from [Philosophy 102, Logic and Reasoning](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2015/spring/PHIL/102) when I was a student at the [University of Illinois](http://illinois.edu/). I also remember the "C" I got. Sweet, (bitter)sweet memories.

To better memorize how [truth value testing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing) works, [exercise 27](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex27.html) said to practice with a series of flash cards while I wait for my ex Jessica to call back. 

There's one problem, though. And it's not that Jessica hasn't texted me back after I documented the ups and downs of our relationship in a novel-length emoji sequence.

The problem is that I'm really lazy. Come on, I ain't gonna make those flash cards. So, I wrote a program to quiz me, grade me, and judge me.

And here it is:

```
# Exercise 27
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex27.html

import random

print "Truth Table quiz!"
print "Answer t for True and f for False"
print "Press any key to begin"

raw_input()

questions = [
    {'q': 'not False', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'not True', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'True or False', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'True or True', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'False or True', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'False or False', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'True and False', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'True and True', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'False and True', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'False and False', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'not (True or False)', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'not (True or True)', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'not (False or True)', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'not (False or False)', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'not (True and False)', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'not (True and True)', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': 'not (False and True)', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': 'not (False and False)', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': '1 != 0', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': '1 != 1', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': '0 != 1', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': '0 != 0', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': '1 == 0', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': '1 == 1', 'a': 't'},
    {'q': '0 == 1', 'a': 'f'},
    {'q': '0 == 0', 'a': 't'},
]

random.shuffle(questions)
answers = []

for q in questions:
    a = raw_input(q['q'] + ': ')
    if a == q['a']:
        print "Correct!"
        answers.append(True)
    else:
        print "Incorrect"
        answers.append(False)

score = float(answers.count(True)) / len(answers) * 100

print "You scored: %d%%" % score
```

You run it just like any other script: `python ex27.py`.

And how did I do? OK, so 84%.

I was going fast.

In between emojis to Jessica.

I am under no false impression that she'll ![Couple with heart]({filename}/images/1f491.png "Couple with heart") ![Face with no good gesture]({filename}/images/1f645.png "Face with no good gesture") ![Recreational vehicle]({filename}/images/1f699.png "Recreational vehicle") ![Neutral face]({filename}/images/1f610.png "Neutral face") ![Expressionless face]({filename}/images/1f611.png "Expressionless face") ![Hamburger]({filename}/images/1f354.png "Hamburger") me back soon enough. And that's the truth.
