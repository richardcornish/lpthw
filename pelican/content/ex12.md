Title: Exercise 12
Date: 2014-11-18 12:19AM

Another night, another exercise. Tonight was [exercise 12](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex12.html), and it builds off of exercise 11. We put strings inside `raw_input()` to make it ask the question instead of separating the questions into `print` statements.

```
# Exercise 12
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex12.html

age = raw_input("How old are you? ")
height = raw_input("How tall are you? ")
weight = raw_input("How much do you weigh? ")

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
    age, height, weight)
```

We also get to use [`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html) to read the documentation in the Terminal. I finally understand why the Python documentation is so ugly: Developers can use the docs from the command line instead!

```
pydoc raw_input
```
