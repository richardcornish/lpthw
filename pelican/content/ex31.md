Title: Exercise 31
Date: 2017-05-02 12:50AM

In [today's lesson](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex31.html), we are combining the [`if`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#if), `elif`, and `else` statements with `raw_input` to create an interactive program.

```

print "You enter a dark room with two doors.  Do you go through door #1, door #2, or door #3.141592653589793? "

door = raw_input("> ")

if door == "1":
    print "There's a giant bear here eating a cheese cake.  What do you do?"
    print "1. Take the cake."
    print "2. Scream at the bear."
    print "x. Return to Dimension X."

    bear = raw_input("> ")

    if bear == "1":
        print "The bear eats your face off.  Good job!"
    elif bear == "2":
        print "The bear eats your legs off.  Good job!"
    elif bear == "x":
        print "Tell Krang I said 'hello.'"
    else:
        print "Well, doing %s is probably better.  Bear runs away." % bear

elif door == "2":
    print "You stare into the endless abyss at Cthulhu's retina."
    print "1. Blueberries."
    print "2. Yellow jacket clothespins."
    print "3. Understanding revolvers yelling melodies."
    print "z. Eat the pizza that Splinter left out for you."

    insanity = raw_input("> ")

    if insanity == "1" or insanity == "2":
        print "Your body survives powered by a mind of jello.  Good job!"
    if insanity == "z":
        print "Cowabunga! It's turtle time!"
    else:
        print "The insanity rots your eyes into a pool of muck.  Good job!"

elif door == "3.141592653589793":
    print "You're so irrational."

else:
    print "You stumble around and fall on a knife and die.  Good job!"
```

I customized it a little bit to add some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I would've expanded on Cthulu, but then I would have had to discuss his spawn building the great green stone city of R'lyeh on the great sunken continent of Mu before it was destroyed by Ythogtha, upon which I would gaze into the unthinkable horror of Cthulu's eyes, rendering me mentally insane.

I wish I made that up as a joke. It's from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu).

This is similar to the "game" I made for [Exercise 27]({filename}/ex27.md). These "games" are deceptively simple. User input, branched logic, and returning the desired ouput is the basis for so much of entertainment, commerce, and education. I was sort of curious to figure out the origin of the "You enter a dark room" game that so many "games" from the early days of computers. I couldn't figure it out! I thought it was a well-known trope, but all I could find was the recent "[A Dark Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dark_Room)" game from a few years ago.

I'll figure out what game this was from, right [Krang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krang)?!
