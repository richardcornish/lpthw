Title: Exercise 13
Date: 2014-11-19 11:16PM

Going to do another two exercises tonight to make up for yesterday. First up was [exercise 13](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex13.html), and it covered variable arguments, which is assigning more than one value to a variable with [`argv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.argv).

```
# Exercise 13
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex13.html

from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third

opinion = raw_input("What do you think of this script? ")
print "You think %s is %s!" % (script, opinion)
```

When run with fewer than three arguments:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex13.py", line 6, in <module>
    script, first, second, third = argv
ValueError: need more than 3 values to unpack
```

It looks like `argv` requires one more value than the following three to run, that is, the first argument is the name of the file or `script` and the following arguments are the ones desired to be referenced in the script. In this example, we'll need four or more values to "unpack" `argv`. If you provide a fourth argument without using it during script execution, it runs as usual.

I added the last two lines to combine `argv` and `raw_input`:

I think I prefer `raw_input` because Python prompts me for an answer to a question rather than me having to remember which argument correspond to which parameters. Of course that's why keyword arguments are so awesome, but we'll get to that later.
