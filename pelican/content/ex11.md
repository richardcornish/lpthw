Title: Exercise 11
Date: 2014-11-17 12:40PM

It's late and I'm trying to get [exercise 11](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex11.html) done before I go to bed. I was reading about how to enable [SSL for free with CloudFlare](http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/) (!) and time got away from me. More on that at the bottom.

```
# Exercise 11
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex11.html

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
    age, height, weight)

print "Do you like bed?",
bed = raw_input()
print "Do you wish you were in bed?",
wish = raw_input()
print "Good night. Sleep...",
tight = raw_input()

print "Do you like bed? %r." % bed
print "Do you wish you were in bed? %r." % wish
print "Good night. Sleep...%r!" % tight
```

Time for something a little more exciting: take the user's input, manipulate it, and display it back. To allow this, we use Python's [`raw_input()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input) method:

> If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised.

And now back to my distraction...

In light of last year's [security scandals](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data), I think it's amazing that companies like CloudFlare are leading the way to democratize HTTPS. As far as I can tell, this blog can now be accessed at a [secure URL](https://richlearnspythonthehardway.org/) so nobody but I (in limited, anonymized ways) or you know that you visited this website.

From [CloudFlare's blog](http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/):

> Having cutting-edge encryption may not seem important to a small blog, but it is critical to advancing the encrypted-by-default future of the Internet. Every byte, however seemingly mundane, that flows encrypted across the Internet makes it more difficult for those who wish to intercept, throttle, or censor the web. 

...hey! I'm not *mundane*. Often.

> In other words, ensuring your personal blog is available over HTTPS makes it more likely that a human rights organization or social media service or independent journalist will be accessible around the world. Together we can do great things.
