And now for the second exericse I'm doing tonight, [exercise 9](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex9.html).

```
# Exercise 9
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex9.html

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

print """
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5 or 6.
"""
```

`%r` prints the new lines, which is interesting because I've been using `\n` for new lines for so long, I don't remember where I learned it or what convention it follows. It turns out Python is [following Unix-style convention](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.newlines), and Wikipedia has a [long, long entry on newlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).

Interestingly, I didn't know you could print a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings), or even that it would print literally.

From the common student questions:

> Is it bad that my errors are always spelling mistakes?

If you've ever worked with a developer, then know that he or she will say at least once (and likely many times) when code doesn't work: "It would help if I could spell correctly."
