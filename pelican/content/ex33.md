Title: Exercise 33
Date: 2017-05-11 1:13PM

The learning [continues](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex33.html) with the [`while`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement) statement, which repeats execution as long as an expression is true.

Here is the code with the changes in the exercise added.

```
# Exercise 33
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex33.html


def while_loop(limit, increment):
    i = 0
    numbers = []

    while i < limit:
        print "At the top i is %d" % i
        numbers.append(i)

        i = i + increment
        print "Numbers now: ", numbers
        print "At the bottom i is %d" % i

    print "The numbers: "

    for num in numbers:
        print num

while_loop(6, 1)


def for_loop(limit, increment):
    for i in range(0, limit, increment):
        print "At the top i is %d" % i
        print "Numbers now: ", range(0, i + increment, increment)
        print "At the bottom i is %d" % (i + increment)
    print "The numbers: "
    for i in range(0, limit, increment):
        print i

for_loop(6, 1)
```

And how it looks when it runs:

You can see in my `for_loop`, I went for a heavy use of [`range`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#range). I'm not sure if this is the "correct" way to do this, but in general I avoided using any sort of [`list`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange) to store values because it seemed like I could do everything on the fly with range.

In all my years of programming, I don't think I've ever used a `while` loop. I would like to, but I can't seem to ever find a scenario for it. I think it's because I am more often looping over things, I want to change or display the things rather than wait for some outside condition to be satisfied. 

However, sometimes programmers do want to run a program forever, which you might see in loggers or trackers that run at intervals. One of my [favorites](https://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/79623717589/house-of-cards-s02e11-about-25-minutes-in-gavin) was [episode 11 of season 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(season_2)#ep24) of House of Cards.

```
int i=0;
while (true) {
    i++;
    status.activityMonitorReturn(i, timeVal);
}
```

The use of `int` for a statically typed language, lowercase boolean `true`, use of `i++` incrementer (which is not part of Python), curly braces, and semicolons makes me think this is either [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). Probably C because there aren't a bazillion classes, right, Java? Zing!
