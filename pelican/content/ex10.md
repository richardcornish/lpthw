I'm trying to get [exercise 10](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex10.html) done today before I have some dim sum for lunch. Yummy!

Today was fun with [escape sequences](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals). I have to admit, about a third of these I know and use, another third I never used and forgot, and the last third I should probably try to remember how they work more often.

One of my favorites to remember is the [ASCII bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character):

> A bell code (sometimes bell character) is a device control code originally sent to ring a small electromechanical bell on tickers and other teleprinters and teletypewriters to alert operators at the other end of the line, often of an incoming message. Though tickers punched the bell codes into their tapes, printers generally do not print a character when the bell code is received.

When video monitors and (rudimentary) audio became a thing, rather than displaying a bell character, it was sensibly replaced with a sound played, which we all know and love when adjusting the sound on our computers.

I decided to add some of my own favorite characters to the exercise for the 16-bit and 32-bit Unicode hexes: the [Apple symbol](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/f8ff/index.htm), which is `\uF8FF`, and the [Pile of Poo](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm), which is `\U0001F4A9`. When you want to print them out, just [prepend a lowercase `u` to the string](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals) before the opening quotation mark.

There's a lot of [joy to be had](http://zachholman.com/posts/abusing-emoji/) with [Unicode](http://inamidst.com/stuff/unidata/), [emoji](http://www.emojitracker.com/), and our dear friend ![Pile of Poo emoji](/images/emoji-poop.png "Pile of Poo emoji"), but I'll leave you with this:
