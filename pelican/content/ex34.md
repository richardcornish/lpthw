Today is all about [`list`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#list)s.

```
# Exercise 34
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex34.html

animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

print "The animal at 1.", "The animal at 1 is at 1 and is a python.", animals[1]

print "The third (3rd) animal.", "The third (3rd) animal is at 2 and is a peacock.", animals[2]

print "The first (1st) animal.", "The first (1st) animal is at 0 and is a bear.", animals[0]

print "The animal at 3.", "The animal at 3 is at 3 and is a kangaroo.", animals[3]

print "The fifth (5th) animal.", "The fifth (5th) animal is at 4 and is a whale.", animals[4]

print "The animal at 2.", "The animal at 2 is at 2 and is a peacock.", animals[2]

print "The sixth (6th) animal.", "The sixth (6th) animal is at 5 and is a platypus.", animals[5]

print "The animal at 4.", "The animal at 4 is at 4 and is a kangaroo.", animals[3]
```

And the output of the program:

I never really liked that Python (or JavaScript) is [zero-indexed](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-python-uses-0-based-indexing.html), but it's something you just sort of accept from computers history of binary. I've also never enjoyed the syntax for list indices, slicing for ranges of numbers, or from the end of a list. I always have to look it up, which means it's not really human friendly, which was why I chose Python in the first place.

Although this will look pretty arrogant of me, let's look at how *I* might have designed lists. **This is not real Python!**

```
>>> fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'watermelon', 'mango']
>>> # I think index 1 should be the first item
>>> fruits[1]
apple
>>> # I think index 0 should be an error because there is no zeroeth item!
>>> fruits[0]
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> # To get the first two, you would say fruits[0:2]; but I think ranges should use pipes, not colons; I also think ranges should be inclusive, not exclusive
>>> fruits[1|2]
['apple', 'orange']
>>> # You can't return a new list with multiple slices, but I think that would be a great feature! It's not hard to imagine comma-delimited ranges.
>>> fruits[1|2, 4|6]
['apple', 'orange', 'strawberry', 'watermelon', 'mango']
>>> # To get the last two, you would do a negative animals[-2:]; I hate thinking the end of my list starts with negative numbers because to me that means *to the left of the list*, so I think doing a range starting from the end of the list, the beginning number should be greater than the last number so it's like you're counting backward
>>> fruits[2|1]
['watermelon', 'mango']
>>> # Admittedly, not using negative indices makes it hard to know which symbol would be good for counting backward for a single item, but maybe just a pipe with no first item would be good enough?
>>> fruits[|1]
['mango']
```

This part at the end of the exercise was kind of weird.

> Programmers will tell you to read this guy named "Dijkstra" on this subject. I recommend you avoid his writings on this unless you enjoy being yelled at by someone who stopped programming at the same time programming started.

What say you about [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)?

> Despite having invented much of the technology of software, Dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a Macintosh computer, he used it only for e-mail and for browsing the World Wide Web. Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his typewriter and later on his Montblanc pen. Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterst√ºck fountain pen. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.

Sounds like a real party guy! ![Party popper emoji]({filename}/images/1f389.png "Party popper emoji")
