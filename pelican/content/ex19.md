[Exercise 19](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex19.html) continues with functions and using variables as arguments.

```
# Exercise 19
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex19.html

# define a function with two parameters
def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
    # print the number of cheeses
    print "You have %d cheeses!" % cheese_count
    # print the number of boxes
    print "You have %d boxes of crackers!" % boxes_of_crackers
    # print your party animal street cred
    print "Man that's enough for a party!"
    # print the necessity for warmth
    print "Get a blanket.\n"

# print description of calling the function
print "We can just give the function numbers directly:"
# call the function with two arguments that are integers
cheese_and_crackers(20, 30)

# print description of calling the function
print "OR, we can use variables from our script:"
# assign integer values to cheese and crackers
amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50
# call the function with two arguments that are variables
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)

# print description of calling the function
print "We can even do math inside too:"
# call the function with two arguments that are addition of integers with plus operator
cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)

# print desciption of calling the function
print "And we can combine the two, variables and math:"
# call the function with two arguments that are variables and addition of integers
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese + 100, amount_of_crackers + 1000)
```

The study drill told me to "write at least one more function of your own design, and run it 10 different ways." I think Zed Shaw meant to use addition, modulo, variable assignment, `argv`, `*args`, etc., to execute the function. But seeing as I'm really lazy, I cheated and created my own random number generator to, well, run it "10 different ways" (at least, 10 ways whose probability of repetition are highly unlikely).

Here it is:

```
import random

def creeping_on_my_ex(text_messages, calls):
    print "You sent %d text messages and made %d calls. Creep!" % (text_messages, calls)

def random_int():
    return random.random() * 100

for x in xrange(1, 11):
    creeping_on_my_ex(random_int(), random_int())
```

I used a [`for`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement) loop (we haven't covered this yet) and [`xrange`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#xrange) to cover a quantity of 10 numbers, and passed in a [random integer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.random) for the arguments of the function. 

What do you think of that, Jessica? Huh? Yeah. That's what I thought.
