Title: Exercise 16
Date: 2014-11-23 2:08AM

I missed last night (see [my thoughts on missed nights]({filename}/ex15.md)), and so it's [Exercise 16](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.html) tonight. More on file opening and manipulation.

```
# Exercise 16
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.html

from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?")
print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w')

# print "Truncating the file.  Goodbye!"
# target.truncate()

print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."
line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."
target.write(line1 + "\n" + line2 + "\n" + line3 + "\n")

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close()

# Read and print the contents of the file
print "\nTime to print out the file:"
target = open(filename, 'r')
print target.read()
target.close()
```

As per the study drills, I added the last few lines to re-open the same file, read its contents, print them to the console, and close the file. I also condensed the multiple `target.write()` methods into one line with string concatenation.

I often found that people who played with file manipulation in languages often forget the arguments that can be passed into the [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open) method:

> The most commonly-used values of mode are `r` for reading, `w` for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and `a` for appending (which on some Unix systems means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). If mode is omitted, it defaults to 'r'.

We need to pass `w` into the `open` method because we are writing to the file, and Python requires the code to explicitly acknowledge the action. The documentation also mentions that if `w` is passed, running [`truncate`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.truncate) on the file object isn't necessary. I commented it out, and my code ran just fine.

That's because this man knows how my code is doing:
