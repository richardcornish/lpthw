Title: Exercise 30
Date: 2017-04-27 2:30PM

Today we [continue learning](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex30.html) about [`if`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#if) statements that have the `elif` and `else` clauses.

```
# Exercise 30
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex30.html

people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15


if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
else:
    print "We can't decide."

if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
elif trucks < cars:
    print "Maybe we could take the trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take the trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay home then."
```

And how it looks:

`elif` is short hand for "else if," which is another conditional evaluated only when the prior statement is `False`, and `else` is finally the catch all. `elif` was always sort of odd to me, in name and partially in logic. Python is usually highly readable and doesn't abbreviate or truncate too many things. `if`, `else`, `for`, `is`, `not`, `in`, `and`, and `or` are all highly readable. Even `True` and `False` are capitalized. Maybe `else if` is a bit too far because it conflicts with `else` (although I don't see much of a problem if a `:` denotes the end of a conditional line), but this is one of those areas where JavaScript got it right with [`else if`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else).

I also remember when `elif` [made it](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3100) into Django's template language as [`{% elif %}`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/builtins/#if), which was a *big deal*. The argument was that template's shouldn't contain too much logic, and that `elif` can be supplanted by nesting additional `if` statements.

Here is today's exercise:

```
if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
else:
    print "We can't decide."
```

And rewritten for nested `if` statements without `elif`:

```
if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
else:
    if cars < people:
        print "We should not take the cars."
    else:
        print "We can't decide."
```

The second version is arguably more readable, but more verbose. However, I think `elif` shines when the conditional is simply one line, in which case it becomes a quick run through of evaluating statements. If you need more verbose checking and logic, then expand as necessary. There are some subtle implications in writing code like this. Should `print "We can't decide."` really be nested? In this scenario, there's no other possible routes, but it could have implications in more complicated code. I might prefer to write it in a more "positive" way by explicitly understanding what we're evaluating:

```
if cars == people:
    print "We can't decide."
else:
    if cars > people:
        print "We should take the cars."
    if cars < people:
        print "We should not take the cars."
```

In this particular case, there's no problem in just omitting `elif` all together, simply because less than and greater than are *mutually exclusive*:

```
if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
if cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
if cars == people:
    print "We can't decide."
```
