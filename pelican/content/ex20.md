Title: Exercise 20
Date: 2014-11-26 10:50PM

Tonight was the big [2-0](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex20.html)! Twenty exercises down, another 32-ish to go. This exercise continues functions, a couple of new file object type functions, and an auto incrementer.

```
# Exercise 20
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex20.html

# import the argv function from the sys module
from sys import argv

# set up script for one parameter
script, input_file = argv

# define function to print contents of file object f
def print_all(f):
    print f.read()

# define function to move cursor to first position of file object f
def rewind(f):
    f.seek(0)

# define function to print the contents of a specific line of file object f, and number of its line
def print_a_line(line_count, f):
    print line_count, f.readline()

# open the passed file and assign it to a variable
current_file = open(input_file)

# print your intent to print
print "First let's print the whole file:\n"

# send file to the print_all function
print_all(current_file)

# print your intent to rewind
print "Now let's rewind, kind of like a tape."

# send the file to the rewind function
rewind(current_file)

# print your intent to print more
print "Let's print three lines:"

# index current line
current_line = 1
# send current line and file to the print_a_line function
# current line = 1
print_a_line(current_line, current_file)

# increment current line by 1
current_line += 1
# send current line and file to the print_a_line function
# current line = 2
print_a_line(current_line, current_file)

# increment current line by 1
current_line += 1
# send current line and file to the print_a_line function
# current line = 1
print_a_line(current_line, current_file)
```

Because it's hard to find anything in the Python documentation, I'll link to and summarize them here:

- [`argv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

    argument variables; passes in names of files to be used during script execution

- [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open)

    opens a file

- [`read`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.read)

    reads the contents of a file, probably stores result in a variable

- [`seek`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek)

    as far as I can tell, "moves cursor" to particular lines of a file

- [`readline`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.readline)

    reads a particular line of a file, probably stores result in a variable

- [`def`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions)

    defines a function

- [`+=`](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements)

    one kind of "augmented assignment statement"; adds one value to a second value and stores result in second value; takes the common case of `exes = exes + 1` and rewrites it to the equivalent (in this case) `exes += 1`
