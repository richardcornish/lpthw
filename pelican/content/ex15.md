Title: Exercise 15
Date: 2014-11-20 11:02PM

Two weeks done! Woo, woo! I had a few stumbles here and there, but I didn't let it get me down. I know other people were interested in learning Python with me, but they couldn't get through [exercise 0](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html). You didn't even have to write any code, but just install Python.

It bums me out that people look at the whole thing and think "I can't do this. It's too much." Just do *one exercise*. Or hell, just *read the exercise*. Just get something done. Maybe something will pique your interest. Maybe natural curiosity will take over. Maybe you'll want to do it because it's--*gasp*--fun. There have already been a few nights that I didn't have time to do my exericse. No big deal, I did two tomorrow, or if that wasn't possible, I would have just done one exercise. And I would have taken 53 days to finish 52 exercises. That's not a big deal when you compare it to doing *0 exercises in 52 days*.

I'm not perfect, which makes my perfectionist skin crawl, but I do my best where I can, and move on to the next thing. The time where I had the luxury to make my code "perfect" I found that there wasn't a perfect answer. Programming is about making tradeoffs. Sometimes there were better ones and there were worse ones, but when you eventually get good enough, you realize that there is no right answer, but only different answers. That's my advice for tonight.

Anyway, back to tonight's exercise... [Exercise 15](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex15.html) is all about opening files! Who needs desktop and a mouse??

```
# Exercise 15
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex15.html

# import argv from the sys module
from sys import argv

# assign the the name of the file as an argument to argv
script, filename = argv

# open the file and assign the result to txt
txt = open(filename)

# print the name of the file and the contents of the file
print "Here's your file %r:" % filename
print txt.read()

# prompt asking the name of the file again
print "Type the filename again:"
file_again = raw_input("> ")

# open the file
txt_again = open(file_again)

# print the contents of the file
print txt_again.read()
```

We're using the [`open`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open) command to, well, open files. The study drills encourage you to also open a file from the Python prompt instead of from Bash, which is slightly less obvious. You have to type in the full path to the file:

```
$ python
>>> file = open("/Users/Rich/Sites/lpthw/exercises/ex15_sample.txt")
```

There are fancier ways of [autodetecting the path to the file](https://docs.python.org/2/library/runpy.html) that is currently being run from within itself, but those are a little out of scope for this lesson.
