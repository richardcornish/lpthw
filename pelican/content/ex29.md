[Today's exercise](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex29.html) is all about the `if` statement.

```
# Exercise 29
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex29.html

people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15


if people < cats:
    print "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"

if people > cats:
    print "Not many cats! The world is saved!"

if people < dogs:
    print "The world is drooled on!"

if people > dogs:
    print "The world is dry!"


dogs += 5

if people >= dogs:
    print "People are greater than or equal to dogs."

if people <= dogs:
    print "People are less than or equal to dogs."


if people == dogs:
    print "People are dogs."
```

And running it:

The `if` statement is "used for conditional execution," according to the [docs](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#if):

> It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section [Boolean operations](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/expressions.html#booleans) for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed (and no other part of the `if` statement is executed or evaluated). If all expressions are false, the suite of the `else` clause, if present, is executed.

The code needs to be indented four spaces because those spaces signify that the code is meant to be run only when the condition is true. If it's not indented, an [`IndentationError`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.IndentationError) exception will be thrown.

Here was a fun one I had to look up: `+=` is shorthand for the [`iadd`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/operator.html#operator.iadd) method of the `operator` module.

> `a = iadd(a, b)` is equivalent to `a += b`.

I remember encountering `+=` in Java and it thoroughly confused me, but when I slowed down to think you could add to a variable and assign the new value back onto itself, it was mind blowing how much clarity that achieved for me. "Computers can do that??"
