Title: Exercise 0
Date: 2014-11-05 11:08PM

I know. I took too long to do this. I learned just enough [Python](https://www.python.org/) to work with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which took course over the past eight (!) years. The first time I installed Django in winter 2006, it took 18 hours over two days. It worked but it was an abomination.

So, today I am going to do one exercise from [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) each day for 52 days until I finish all 52 exercises. I'm going to write about my experiences, good or bad. I'm most fluent in [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) because of my background as a designer and front-end developer, but I have some basic Python knowledge from using Django. We're going to find out how basic.

The ["zeroth" exercise](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html) doesn't have any code to write. It's just opening Terminal on a Mac, a Python shell, and Googling when you get stuck, which is what I guess I do most of the time anyway. I spent about an hour making this blog with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/), [Virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/), [Virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/), and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

Because there isn't much to share from the book, here is how I installed Python with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Edit your `~/.bash_profile` in the text editor of your chocie to get ready for what's coming:

```
# Paths
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Virtualenv
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs

# Virtualenvwrapper
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

Now install Xcode's command line tools, Homebrew, and Python:

```
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install python
```
