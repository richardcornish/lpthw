Title: Exercise 32
Date: 2017-05-02 2:40PM

[Today's lesson](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex32.html) is all about looping through [`list`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange)s with the [`for`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) statement, and a little bit of the [`range`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#range) method.

```
# Exercise 32
# https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex32.html

the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
for number in the_count:
    print "This is count %d" % number

# same as above
for fruit in fruits:
    print "A fruit of type: %s" % fruit

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# notice we have to use %r since we don't know what's in it
for i in change:
    print "I got %r" % i

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
for i in range(0, 6):
    print "Adding %d to the list." % i
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)

# now we can print them out too
for i in elements:
    print "Element was: %d" % i
```

And how it looks when it runs:

![Exercise 32]({filename}/images/ex32-1.png "Exercise 32")

`range` returns a `list`, so there's no need to write:

```
for i in range(0, 6):
    print "Adding %d to the list." % i
    # append is a function that lists understand
    elements.append(i)
```

You can simply say:

```
elements = range(0, 6)
```

Like so:

![Exercise 32]({filename}/images/ex32-2.png "Exercise 32")

But...you just wouldn't ever really do that in real life from my experience. `range` already returns a list, so why put it into a variable? There are times you might want to keep track of the index of a `list`, but you would do that on a list that had other kinds of data, in which case, the Pythonic way is [`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#enumerate).

```
for a, b in enumerate(fruits):
    print a, b
0 apples
1 oranges
2 pears
3 apricots
```

This is an interesting lesson because it again reminds me of how awful the Python 2 documentation is. Search is your friend, but it shouldn't have to be. When one thinks of lists (or "sequences"), one quickly thinks of iteration, and `for` is the Pythonic way to do that. `for`--and `list`s in general--isn't mentioned at all in the [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html) page. Instead the `for` documentation is over in the [Compound statements](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#for) documentation. Python 3 has a proper section on [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#lists), but `for` is only briefly mentioned in "using a list comprehension", and it's not explained or linked to its proper place.

I think this is why more people don't learn to program. Programming is already an alien language for people, but the documentation, the one place for readability and comprehension to occur, is organized in a way that is optimized for a computer. Let's make the computer work for us and design for humans first. After all, isn't Python supposed to be readable?
