Title: Exercise 6
Date: 2014-11-11 3:05PM

Today I finished the thrill ride known as [exercise 6](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex6.html).

```
# Exercise 6
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex6.html

# Assign values to cryptic variables
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not) # 1) and 2) a string inside a string

# Print x and y
print x
print y

# Print the literal representation of x and the string of y
print "I said: %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y # 3) a string inside a string

# Determine how funny this joke is and allow evaluation to have a literal representation value appended to it
hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"

# Print the evaluation and insert the hilarious status into it
print joke_evaluation % hilarious

# Assign strings to variables w and e
w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

# Print the concatenation of w and e
print w + e
```

It looked a little like this:

As for the study drills, I could only find three places where a string was inserted into another string, not the four Zed claimed that there might be. He lied to me. Zed Shaw lied to me, just like my last girlfriend. Tell me, *Jessica*: If I didn't own any goldfish, why did I have the bowl, huh?

It was frustrating how difficult it was to find that the plus symbol is overloaded as an operator for addition and string concatenation in the Python documentation. Yes, it's that way in many dynamic languages, but sometimes it feels like the documentation was written by a scientific standards committee--not that there is anything wrong with that ([science](/images/science.gif)!)--but this [doesn't exactly roll off the tongue](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation
):

> 2.4.2. String literal concatenation
> ...
> Note that this feature is defined at the syntactical level, but implemented at compile time. The `+` operator must be used to concatenate string expressions at run time. Also note that literal concatenation can use different quoting styles for each component (even mixing raw strings and triple quoted strings).

I worked on today's exercise at my favorite coffee shop, [Julius Meinl](http://www.yelp.com/biz/julius-meinl-chicago-3), so here is a photo of the chocolate cupcake I ate. You can't beat $2.95!
