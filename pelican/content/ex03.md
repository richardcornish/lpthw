Title: Exercise 3
Date: 2014-11-08 1:49PM

Today was [exercise 3](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex3.html). I learned about arithmetic operators.

I entered these lines into a `.py` file and ran it with `python ex03.py`:

```
# Exercise 3
# http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex3.html

# Announce the counting of the chickens
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# Prints Hens and Roosters counts, according to "operator precedence"

# 25 + 30 / 6
# 25 + 5
# 30
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6

# 100 - 75 % 4
# 100 - 3
# 97
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# Announce the counting of the eggs
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# Compute the egg expression
# 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
# 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 0 - 0 + 6
# 5 + -4 + 0 + 6
# 1 + 6
# 7
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# Ask a question
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# Print AND compute the expression AND compare them
# 5 < -2
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 # False

# Print the question AND compute the expression
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2 # 5
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7 # -2

# Print a grand revelation
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Print your desire to continue
print "How about some more."

# Print the question AND compute the expression, now with more truthiness
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2 # True
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= 2 # True
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2 # False
```

I'm surprised that Zed doesn't try to call the operators, well, operators or mention [operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence). Instead he opts for "symbols" and doesn't explain the less obvious operators, like modulo (`%`), until the "common student questions."

I am hard pressed to think of a time when I've used modulo, and I usually have to look it up or screw around in the Terminal. When I ask developers, I usually get the same reaction.

Once and for all, from the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations):

> The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second.

Example:

```
>>> 6 % 3 # 6 / 3 = 2, or 2 with remainder 0
```

In plain English: 3 divides 6 two times, with a remainder of 0. The modulo is zero.

Example:

```
>>> 3 % 4 # 3 / 4 = 0.75, or 0 with remainder 3
```

In plain English: 4 divides 3 zero times, with a remainder of, well, 3. The modulo is three.

He also doesn't mention the difference between integers and floating point numbers (or decimal numbers) when it comes to arithmetic. I understand that [it](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex) [goes](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) [much](https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html), [much](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#why-are-floating-point-calculations-so-inaccurate) [deeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point) than it should have gone, but it should be called out just for student awareness.

I'm not saying he should just say "go read the Python docs," which are ugly and for the most part incomprehensible, but there's a middle ground between enticing, explanation, and reference.

Also, just remember:

> Every programming language has some kind of way of doing numbers and math. Do not worry: programmers lie frequently about being math geniuses when they really aren't. If they were math geniuses, they would be doing math, not writing buggy web frameworks so they can drive race cars.
