Title: Exercise 14
Date: 2014-11-19 11:50PM

Next up tonight was [exercise 14](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex14.html). The code more tightly integrated `argv`, `raw_input` and docstrings.

```

from sys import argv

script, user_name, lucky_charm = argv
prompt = '$$$ '

print "Hi %s, I'm the %s script." % (user_name, script)
print "I'd like to ask you a few questions."
print "Do you like me %s?" % user_name
likes = raw_input(prompt)

print "Where do you live %s?" % user_name
lives = raw_input(prompt)

print "What kind of computer do you have?"
computer = raw_input(prompt)

print """
Alright, so you said %r about liking me.
You live in %r. Not sure where that is.
And you have a %r computer. Nice.
Your lucky charm is a %r.
""" % (likes, lives, computer, lucky_charm)
```

As I am obligated to fulfill the study drills, finding information about [Zork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) was pretty easy:

> Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977â€“1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer.

Adventure was a little harder because the name was so generic. Funnily enough, I remember seeing this title when watching a pseudo documentary on the video game [E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial_(video_game)) for the [Atari 2600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600).

[Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1979_video_game)) was one of the games on the Atari 2600:

> Adventure is a video game for the Atari 2600 video game console, released in Christmas 1979 or 1980. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to hunt an open world environment for a hidden magical chalice, returning it to the yellow castle. The game world is also populated by roaming enemies: dragons, which can eat the avatar; and a bat, which randomly steals and hides items around the game world.

Finding and playing Zork was a bit of a challenge because versions of it were released for several platforms over several *decades*, but I found an [emulator of Atari 2600](http://stella.sourceforge.net/) and an [Adventure ROM](http://www.atariage.com/system_items.html?SystemID=2600&ItemTypeID=ROM). It kind of worked once, but it was pretty buggy. A guy moved around and you try to hit him with a block of pixels. All in all, pretty terrible, even by "old school" standards.
