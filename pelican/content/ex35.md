Title: Exercise 35
Date: 2017-05-23 2:44AM

Today's [lesson](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex35.html) doesn't have much original coding. Instead we're simply examining an existing program and understanding how it works.

```
from sys import exit

def gold_room():
    print "This room is full of gold.  How much do you take?"

    choice = raw_input("> ")
    if "0" in choice or "1" in choice:
        how_much = int(choice)
    else:
        dead("Man, learn to type a number.")

    if how_much < 50:
        print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win!"
        exit(0)
    else:
        dead("You greedy bastard!")


def bear_room():
    print "There is a bear here."
    print "The bear has a bunch of honey."
    print "The fat bear is in front of another door."
    print "How are you going to move the bear?"
    bear_moved = False

    while True:
        choice = raw_input("> ")

        if choice == "take honey":
            dead("The bear looks at you then slaps your face off.")
        elif choice == "taunt bear" and not bear_moved:
            print "The bear has moved from the door. You can go through it now."
            bear_moved = True
        elif choice == "taunt bear" and bear_moved:
            dead("The bear gets pissed off and chews your leg off.")
        elif choice == "open door" and bear_moved:
            gold_room()
        else:
            print "I got no idea what that means."


def cthulhu_room():
    print "Here you see the great evil Cthulhu."
    print "He, it, whatever stares at you and you go insane."
    print "Do you flee for your life or eat your head?"

    choice = raw_input("> ")

    if "flee" in choice:
        start()
    elif "head" in choice:
        dead("Well that was tasty!")
    else:
        cthulhu_room()


def dead(why):
    print why, "Good job!"
    exit(0)

def start():
    print "You are in a dark room."
    print "There is a door to your right and left."
    print "Which one do you take?"

    choice = raw_input("> ")

    if choice == "left":
        bear_room()
    elif choice == "right":
        cthulhu_room()
    else:
        dead("You stumble around the room until you starve.")


start()
```

This one was a little hard to diagram, but it eventually came together. I usually try to make sure the lines don't cross, but I don't think that was possible here. It's amazing how expressive code is in such a short space, while graphics, which are easier to understand at a glance, are so much more verbose and can be overwhelming quickly.

The `gold_room` function is kind of weird. One doesn't check the if the input has a `0` or `1` to understand if it's a number. The [Pythonic way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3501382/checking-whether-a-variable-is-an-integer-or-not) is to use the [`isinstance`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#isinstance) method: `if isinstance(choice, (int, long))`.
